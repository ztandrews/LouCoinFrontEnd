The html page for LouCoin

This is just the html page for the code on my [LouCoin](https://github.com/ztandrews/loucoin) Repo.

Its not the same one that gets deployed to [loucoin.com](https://loucoin.com), but it's about the same. I didn't put the exact one because it has some links on it that relate to the firebase repo that it is served on, so I didn't want those public. This is, though, the test html file that I use for when I want to try new things, and is thus pretty much a carbon copy of the main file.
